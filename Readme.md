# TeamSpeak for arm (using Box86 or QEMU)

Based on arm32v7/debian:stable-slim<br/>
Or arm64v8/debian:stable-slim

Tested on an RPi3b+ running Raspbian<br/>
And RPi3b+ running Ubuntu 20.04 (aarch64)


## Which tag should I use?

If you have a fast connection to "teamspeak.com" -> Use the :latest tag</br>
Otherwise -> Use the :latest-predownloaded tag

The only difference between them is that the :latest-predownloaded tag comes with a TeamSpeak 3 server already downloaded, while the :latest tag will download the latest version during setup.

The arm32v7 images are using Box86 (https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86), while arm64v8 is still using qemu.
You should ALWAYS prefer the arm32v7 image, because Box86 has some advantages over qemu! Only use the arm64v8 images if absolutely want to use arm64v8 or qemu!

#### Box86 shows some warnings, but it still works. Maybe they will disappear with a newer version. 

## :latest
### Run example:
Use something like this and replace {path} and timezone to your liking:

```shell
docker run -d --name TeamSpeak3_Server -e TS_UPDATE=1 -e TIME_ZONE=Europe/Berlin -p 9987:9987/udp -p 10011:10011/tcp -p 30033:30033/tcp -v {path}/:/teamspeak/save/ ertagh/teamspeak3-server:arm32v7-latest-box86
```
#### Have patience after you started the container. It will take some time and your CPU load will be pretty high during initialization. 

## :latest-predownloaded
### Run example:
Use something like this and replace {path} and timezone to your liking:

```shell
docker run -d --name TeamSpeak3_Server -e TIME_ZONE=Europe/Berlin -p 9987:9987/udp -p 10011:10011/tcp -p 30033:30033/tcp -v {path}/:/teamspeak/save/ ertagh/teamspeak3-server:arm32v7-latest-box86-predownloaded
```
#### Have patience after you started the container. It will take some time and your CPU load will be pretty high during initialization. 

#### Note:</br>
With :latest-predownloaded you can update the server either by using the integrated updater OR you can pull the latest :latest-predownloaded image and redeploy your container.

### TS_UPDATE
If you set the updater to 0, but you still want to update to a newer version, just put a empty file called "update" inside the "save"-folder and restart the container.

### TS_UPDATE_BACKUP
The backup is located in the "backup"-folder within the "save"-folder.
There will be no versioning inside the backup-script. If you want to keep more than just your previous version, you have to do this by yourself.

### Update check
Once every week the container will check if the installed version is still the newest one. If not, there will be a message inside the log.

### Recovery
If you made an update, but the new version doesn't work or you just want to go back to the old one, just put an empty file called "recover" inside the "save"-folder and restart the container.</br>
You can run the "recover.sh" inside the container as well, it'll do the same.
