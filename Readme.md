# TeamSpeak for everything
### Formerly known as TeamSpeak for arm (using QEMU or Box86)

Based on debian:buster-slim<br/>

Tested on an RPi3b+ running Raspbian<br/>
And RPi3b+ running Ubuntu 20.04 (aarch64)


## Which tag should I use?

If you have a fast connection to "teamspeak.com" -> Use :latest-box <br/>
Otherwise -> Use :latest-box-predownloaded

If you want to use QEMU instead of Box86/Box64 -> Use :latest / :latest-predownloaded

The only difference between images with and without predownloaded tag is that the images with predownloaded tag already have a predownloaded TeamSpeak 3 Server built in, while the other will download one during setup.

#### Overview:<br/>
:latest -> QEMU (arm32v5, arm32v7 and arm64v8 available), x86, x64<br/>
:latest-predownloaded -> QEMU (arm32v5, arm32v7 and arm64v8 available), x86, x64<br/>
:latest-box -> Box86/Box64 (arm32v7 and arm64v8)<br/>
:latest-box-predownloaded -> Box86/Box64 (arm32v7 and arm64v8)
<br/>
<br/>

## :latest-box
### Run example:
Use something like this and replace {path} and timezone to your liking:

```shell
docker run -d --name TeamSpeak3_Server -e TS_UPDATE=1 -e TIME_ZONE=Europe/Berlin -p 9987:9987/udp -p 10011:10011/tcp -p 30033:30033/tcp -v {path}/:/teamspeak/save/ ertagh/teamspeak3-server:latest-box
```
#### Have patience after you started the container.

## :latest-box-predownloaded
### Run example:
Use something like this and replace {path} and timezone to your liking:

```shell
docker run -d --name TeamSpeak3_Server -e TIME_ZONE=Europe/Berlin -p 9987:9987/udp -p 10011:10011/tcp -p 30033:30033/tcp -v {path}/:/teamspeak/save/ ertagh/teamspeak3-server:latest-box-predownloaded
```
#### Have patience after you started the container.

## Server Admin Privilege Key
You can find the key in 3 different ways:
- You can use the docker logs command and may be able to catch the key that way (Way easier if you're using e.g. Portainer)
- Inside {path} is a 'logs' directory. Use for example 'cat' to show the content of the !first! log that ends with '_1.log'
- As an alternative to the second way you can connect to the container directly: 'docker exec -it {NameOfContainer} /bin/bash'. Next go to the 'logs' directory and 'cat' the content of the first log that ends with '_1.log'

<br/>
<br/>

## Notes:</br>
- With predownloaded tags you can update the server either by using the integrated updater OR you can pull the latest predownloaded image and redeploy your container.
- QEMU will take some time to startup. During that time your CPU load will be pretty high.

### TS_UPDATE
If you set the updater to 0, but you still want to update to a newer version, just put a empty file called "update" inside the "save"-folder and restart the container.

### TS_UPDATE_BACKUP
The backup is located in the "backup"-folder within the "save"-folder.
There will be no versioning inside the backup-script. If you want to keep more than just your previous version, you have to do this by yourself.

### Update check
Every sunday the container will check if the installed version is still up-to-date. If not, there will be a message inside the log.

### Recovery
If you made an update, but the new version doesn't work or you just want to go back to the old one, just put an empty file called "recover" inside the "save"-folder and restart the container.<br/>
You can run the "recover.sh" inside the container as well, it'll do the same.

### Debug
If you want to enter debug mode you can either set the env for a permanent debug mode, or just create a empty file called "debug" inside the "save"-folder and restart the container.
